            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><em>Last updated: November 19, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Readable Spokable PDF is a client-side web application that runs entirely in your browser.
                We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how your data is handled.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your data to our servers because we don't have any servers.
                All processing happens locally in your browser.</p>

            <h2>Local Storage</h2>
            <p>The application stores data locally in your browser using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LocalStorage:</strong> API keys and UI preferences (dark mode, welcome banner state)</li>
                <li><strong>IndexedDB:</strong> Uploaded PDF files, processed text, batches, logs, and settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The application communicates with the following third-party services:</p>

            <h3>Google AI Studio (Gemini API)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose: Text transformation using AI</li>
                <li>Data sent: Text extracted from your PDFs, your API key</li>
                <li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy
                        Policy</a></li>
                <li>Your API key is sent directly from your browser to Google's servers</li>
                <li>We do not intercept, log, or store your API communications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CDN Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose: Loading PDF.js and jsPDF libraries</li>
                <li>Provider: Cloudflare CDN</li>
                <li>Data sent: Standard HTTP request headers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>API Keys</h2>
            <p>
                Your Google AI Studio API key is stored only in your browser's LocalStorage. It is never
                transmitted to any server other than Google AI Studio endpoints. You can clear your API
                key at any time from the Settings panel.
            </p>

            <h2>File Processing</h2>
            <p>
                When you upload a PDF:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The file is read and processed entirely in your browser</li>
                <li>Text is extracted using PDF.js (client-side)</li>
                <li>Extracted text is sent to Google AI Studio for transformation</li>
                <li>The original PDF and transformed text are stored in your browser's IndexedDB</li>
                <li>No files are uploaded to our servers (we don't have any)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Logs</h2>
            <p>
                The application maintains local logs of API requests and processing events for debugging
                purposes. These logs are stored in IndexedDB and never leave your browser. API keys in
                logs are automatically redacted. You can view, export, or clear logs from the Diagnostics page.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                This application does not use cookies.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>
                You can delete your data at any time:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Individual files: Use the delete button on stored files</li>
                <li>API keys: Use "Clear API Keys" in Settings</li>
                <li>All data: Use "Erase All Data" in Settings → Advanced</li>
                <li>Browser data: Clear your browser's LocalStorage and IndexedDB manually</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                While we implement security best practices, please note:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your API key is stored in plain text in LocalStorage (browser limitation)</li>
                <li>Anyone with access to your device can potentially access stored data</li>
                <li>Use device-level security (passwords, encryption) to protect your data</li>
                <li>Don't share your API key with others</li>
                <li>Regularly clear stored files if they contain sensitive information</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                This service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information
                from children.
            </p>
